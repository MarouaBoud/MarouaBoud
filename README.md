## Note on Confidential Projects

This GitHub represents my **personal** and **open-source** work.  
Due to client confidentiality and data sensitivity, my professional projects — including those for **Stealth Power** and **LCL Bank** — are hosted on private company repositories.  

To maintain transparency, I’ve included summaries below covering **architectures**, **tech stacks**, and **key outcomes**, without exposing proprietary data or code.
